# PostgreSQL-Spectacle-Theater-ER-Diagram
The project uses draw.io application in VS code to model ER diagram for a spectacle theater and used the SQL DDL statements to develop the database as well as the tables and the columns applying the defined constraints from the diagram.

# Intro ....
The idea is to design a database for a movie theater that has required tables and columns as defined through the business requirements.
The database has the following tables: Film, Auditorium, Event, Customers, and Account. The columns of these tables are defined based on requirement to management the business, keeping track of the every day activities.

# ER Diagram...
Consider this ER diagram for the spectacle movie theater database model, the ER diagram was developed on VS code with the "draw.io" application. "draw.io" is the only application that can do this for us, other applications are visio, SQLDBM,QuickDBD, Lucidchart etc.
